Flower Facade



you know it to be true,
you know this also too

   that this yellowing pace is just the same as our fallen grace


dusting the ground, a vibrant hue

changing this callous means to a perennial preen

   If only in life this was all that was due


Alas we are trapped in a requiem of yellow, black and blue


turn your edges to the sky

basking in radiant waves


finally at peace with the world's ballad of prosey speech


we abate to sullen craze
